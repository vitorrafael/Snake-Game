# Snake Game

This is a Snake Game developed using ReactJS with TypeScript.

I started developing this game a long time ago with JavaScript, when I was just starting to learn frontend development more seriously.
Sometimes, I like to come back to it and do some improvements or test new ways of implementing a feature with knowledge that I have recently acquired.

Run  `yarn start` to start the game and have fun!
